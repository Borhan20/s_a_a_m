**Smart Attendance Automation using Face Recognition (Research Project)
**

As part of my undergraduate thesis, I'm actively involved in this projectâ€”a pioneering classroom attendance management system driven by face recognition and deep learning. The system leverages cutting-edge deep neural networks integrated with mobile applications to automate attendance tracking, streamline administrative tasks, and enhance accuracy. The primary aim is to develop an intelligent system capable of robust real-time performance and adaptability. Our current focus is on refining the face recognition model and developing the accompanying mobile app.
